# Rosay-Praying-Software
STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!


A software to help pray to the rosary.
Made by Collin Calloway
This project is a project made for anyone to use, all code is open source and all code is for any use you may need.
I'd like to dedicate this project to our Lord and savior; Jesus Christ, our Holy Mother Mary who blessed us with our savior and Lord, and lastly our blessed Carlo Acutis.

*DATA STRUCTURE:
    This software uses a Data structure for the Rosary Prayers with a system for organizing the days of the weeks, As well as asigning them the Mysteries of each day. 
    The system also tells you what series of prayers such as Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, And the other prayers one would use.
*PROGRAM FLOW:
    Using User input the user providess the current day of the week to which the program will determine the day's mystery as well as the Prayer steps for the Rosary.
*COMPONENTS STILL IN WORK:
    --User Input
    --The logic in the system for finding the right mysteries and prayers
    --the displaying of the prayers (Output)
*FINISHED IDEAS AND PARTS OF THE PROJECT:
    --Dictionary or set of lists to where the mysteries and prayers for each day of the week


##Note 1: 9:31 pm
    I've written the rules and things needed for the project, as well as the overall systems needed.
##Note 2: 10:44 pm
    Ive put in a string list of the days of the week, I'll be using this later when i actually build the full system. The other things ive implemented are a system to select the day of the week but theres nothing but it just telling you a output of "you selected this day." From there i will try and add more of the project later. I also added the first Mystery of the Rosary as well so that way it can tell you everything there is to say.
##Note 3 10:55 pm: Ive been working on this project more and more everyday it seems, I've put in major systems for the basics but nothing to groundbreaking, for the most part this is just something i want to take at my own time. Further ideas may expand this outward but for now it is just a little side project to further my knowlegdge of both my faith and my coding skills.
